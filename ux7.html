                    <p>Hymnal.net is an online search database originally created based on a classic collection of approximately 1348 hymns compiled by Living Stream Ministry in a printed publication titled Hymns. For every hymn, an instrumental tune player, piano and guitar sheets, and hymn lyrics are available. This database offers a powerful search engine as well as hierarchically structured category tabs for browse search.</p>
                    <p>Through usability tests, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the category tabs based on users' musical backgrounds and domain familiarity.</p>
                    <p>The result was the category tabs were not effective for users with either expert musical background and domain familiarity alone. Comparatively, one with high domain familiarity as well as familiarity with the categories in the Hymnal publication performed surprisingly well.</p>
